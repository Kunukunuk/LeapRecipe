### Steps to Run the App
- Clone the repo and run the app
- Three toolbar buttons on the side to test out different scenarios

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
- I focused on making everything work and function correctly

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
- Around 3-4 hours
- Built the views and then the logic
- Modify the response view model to get the URLs from the strings

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
- Wanted to build fast prototype therefore used SwiftUI.
- Make a lot of logic on the SwiftUI views, could maybe move the logic to the ViewModel.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- Testing as there is limited testing as logic is in the SwiftUI views.

### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
- No

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered
- I tried to use the old way for storing NSCache but realized that the SwiftUI have AsyncImage that takes care a lot of the logic which is nice.
